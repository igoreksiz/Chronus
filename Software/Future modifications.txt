"Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes."

Description of Chronus modifications
	Major
	
	Minor
		The order of analyses is changed when the final report is created. This must be corrected so the order is preserved.
	
		There is prototype for a new watch window for the data reduction process that should be implemented. In the first 
		attempt, there were some decrease of the program efficiency.
		
		With the objective to compile the results os standard through the year, a new tool was designed to search standards'
		results in SlpStdCorr sheets. This tool must be redesigned to allow the search for more information in SlpStdCorr
		and SlpStdBlkCorr sheet.
		
		Create a way to plot the ages calculated using ArcGIS.
		
	Patches
		When the final report is being created, if the background of any of the analyses is filled, an error is raised.
