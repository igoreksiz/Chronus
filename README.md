Chronus - A program for U-Pb data obtained by LA-MC-ICPMS Chronus is developed by me, as part of my master's project 
(https://goo.gl/W2uKn2). The program was designed to handle all U-Pb data produced using a LA-MC-ICPMS system installed at the 
Geochronology Laboratory of the University of Brasilia (see BÃ¼hn et al, 2009). Visual Basic for Applications and Python are the 
language used to write Chronus code. See the project's page on ResearchGate (https://goo.gl/Y9Z5OA).
